# Overview

This program is a simple chess game. It currently allows for two players to play chess. It will display possible moves when you select a piece, and will notify you if your king is in check. Currently, the program does not yet track check mates accurately, and so there is a button that will appear upon check to allow you to submit defeat if you are caught in a check mate. Alternatively, you can move any other piece while leaving your king in check to end the game in a check mate.

# Development Environment

This program is written in Python, and makes use of the pygame engine/library to render the game.

# Useful Websites

As a challenge, I did not use this second site, but I will going forward to finish up my project, and add an ai bot.

# Future Work

* Finish adding functionality to analyzing checkmate. Currently the program can only detect "check" due to lack of time.
* Add some sort of AI aponent. This will obviously take more time than adding checkmante, so this could be for several years from now.
